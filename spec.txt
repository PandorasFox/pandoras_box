The base product is just a python script that will read from a config.json file and control the strip based off of that appropriately.

Base product reqs:
* reading config.json
* setting "zones" of different lengths/patterns on one strip
* different animation support
* controlling groups of zones as one zone (i.e. 3 zones each treated as an individual LED, and solid)
* fading colors, and the math to go with that

Light controller should be a daemon that's controllable over dbus.

Currently, all of the above is working. The daemon stuff needs to be fleshed out more, as does the CTL script.

I probably need to ship my own daemonization. It'll be fun to learn that, anyways.

The script now should only be run as a regular user, using SPI. I need to flesh it out / set it up a bit better to be used as that, and possibly provide some sort of installer / raspbian package.

I may also need to use the dbus session bus instead of system bus. However, my raspi running without a graphical session has no session bus...
