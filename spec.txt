The base product is just a python script that will read from a config.json file and control the strip based off of that appropriately, and will reload the config.json file when it is updated by another process.

Base product reqs:
* reading config.json
* setting "zones" of different lengths/patterns on one strip
* different animation support
* controlling a "zone" as one single LED, or as a bunch of LEDs
  * the entire thing will basically just be an array of zones, with their individual associated effects
* controlling groups of zones as one zone (i.e. 3 zones each treated as an individual LED, and solid)
* fading colors, and the math to go with that
* when config.json is updated by another process, reload it, parse it, and restart the lights controller (or maybe just update it? idk)

Additional goals:
* some sort of web frontend (with simple TOTP auth - no password, just the 2fa) for reading & displaying the config.json
* maybe git webhooks for the full thing
