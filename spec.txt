The base product is just a python script that will read from a config.json file and control the strip based off of that appropriately.

Base product reqs:
* reading config.json
* setting "zones" of different lengths/patterns on one strip
* different animation support
* controlling groups of zones as one zone (i.e. 3 zones each treated as an individual LED, and solid)
* fading colors, and the math to go with that

Light controller should be a daemon that's controllable over dbus.

Currently, all of the above is working. The daemon stuff needs to be fleshed out more, as does the CTL script.

Additionally, I need to see about potentially controlling a rasp pi's PWM over GPIO as a non-root user with some udev rules. If this is possible, I may just be able to install a udev rule and a unit file, and allow the rest of the stuff to reside in user-owned space.

Currently, since the script needs root, allowing users to run animations from user-owned directories is a decent security issue. I'll either need to figure out how to run the script as non-root, or it'll have to be a proper system daemon that runs as root.

Additional goals:
* some sort of web frontend (with simple TOTP auth - no password, just the 2fa) for reading & displaying the config.json
