# Pandora's Box

I'm writing some scripts for controlling my ws2812B RGB LED strips with my raspberry pi.

The main purpose behind most of this is so that I can easily dim the brightness on the lights (or change the lighting patterns/mood) from my phone, in my bed.

The eventual goals are outlined in spec.txt

Uses [rpi\_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x) and [colour](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colour)
