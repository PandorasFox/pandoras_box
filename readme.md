# Pandora's Box

I'm writing some scripts for controlling my ws2812B RGB LED strips with my raspberry pi.

The main purpose behind most of this is so that I can easily dim the brightness on the lights (or change the lighting patterns/mood) from my phone, in my bed.

The eventual goals are outlined in spec.txt
